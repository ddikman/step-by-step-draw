# step-by-step-draw
This is a simple javascript driven web page that draws a winner based on a list of people.

It will display each entry with initials and finally showcase a winners name.

It was written for Infuse Consulting Ltd. to enable us to draw a winner on conferences.

## how to

1. Download the zip file under releases
2. Unzip it locally
3. Edit the `names.txt`, inputting your entries
4. Open `draw.htm`
5. Press space to remove a number of entries

The number of draws is configured in `draw.js` and the time in between each entry gets flipped increases so in the end it will take a few seconds between each entry gets flipped. Finally the winners name will be presented in full.
